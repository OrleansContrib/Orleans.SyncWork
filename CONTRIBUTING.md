Open to contributions from the community.

I'd prefer an issue be opened for some discussion on potential enhancements, questions, bug fixes, etc.  
Right now I (Kritner) am the only one that will be accepting PRs, so I'd very much appreciate for any fixes/features to have additional unit tests added to help 
demonstrate the change is working as you intend it to.

See an issue in the documentation? Throw me a PR!  Want it to be tagged hacktoberfest-accepted? let me know!  
If there's something feature you want added, add an issue and throw a PR if you so desire.  Want to add some additional samples of use?  Go for it!

Not really sure what additional information to have here.  Just keep in mind that people could theoretically be using this thing, so I'll be trying to stick with semver, and not introduce obviously breaking changes to the API.

Are you actually using this package?  Let me know and I'll link your repo in the readme!
